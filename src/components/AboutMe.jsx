          Hi there! Nice to meet you and welcome to my personal portfolio. Whether you are looking to learn more about me personally
          or just take a look at the projects I have worked on, you have come to the right place. I am a web developer with a passion
          of creating and designing websites with a purpose. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the field of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Oregon with a Full Stack Web Developement Certificate and have been working on projects ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, friends and 3 fur babies, hiking, and traveling. Video games are also a big part of my life, so if you have any recommendations, I would love to hear them!
        </p>
        <p>
            Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to work together. I am always open to new opportunities and connections. In the meantime, feel free to take a look around and enjoy!
        </p>
